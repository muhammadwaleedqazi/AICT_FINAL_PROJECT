          satisfying,
          and the hunting and fishing mechanics are surprisingly deep. But it's the little details that truly elevate the
          gameplay â€“ the way Arthur interacts with his horse, the realistic animations, and the dynamic weather system all
          contribute to an unparalleled level of immersion.</p>

        <h3>Graphics and Sound</h3>

          incredibly
          lifelike. The lighting and weather effects are particularly impressive, creating a truly immersive atmosphere.
